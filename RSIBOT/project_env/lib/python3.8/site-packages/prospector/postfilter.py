    This method post-processes all messages output by all tools, in order to filter
    out any based on the overall output.

    The main aim currently is to use information about messages suppressed by
    pylint due to inline comments, and use that to suppress messages from other
    tools representing the same problem.

    For example:

        import banana  # pylint:disable=unused-import

    In this situation, pylint will not warn about an unused import as there is
    inline configuration to disable the warning. Pyflakes will still raise that
    error, however, because it does not understand pylint disabling messages.
    This method uses the information about suppressed messages from pylint to
    squash the unwanted redundant error from pyflakes and frosted.

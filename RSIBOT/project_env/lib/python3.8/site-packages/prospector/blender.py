# This module contains the logic for "blending" of errors.
# Since prospector runs multiple tools with overlapping functionality, this
# module exists to merge together equivalent warnings from different tools for
# the same line. For example, both pyflakes and pylint will generate an
# "Unused Import" warning on the same line. This is obviously redundant, so we
# remove duplicates.
